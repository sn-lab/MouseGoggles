// Looking at SPI communication in a logic analyzer, it is observed that waiting for the finish of an SPI command FIFO causes pretty exactly one byte of delay to the command stream.
// Therefore the time/bandwidth cost of ending the current span and starting a new span is as follows:
// 1 byte to wait for the current SPI FIFO batch to finish,
// +1 byte to send the cursor X coordinate change command,
// +1 byte to wait for that FIFO to flush,
// +2 bytes to send the new X coordinate,
// +1 byte to wait for the FIFO to flush again,
// +1 byte to send the data_write command,
// +1 byte to wait for that FIFO to flush,
// after which the communication is ready to start pushing pixels. This totals to 8 bytes, or 4 pixels, meaning that if there are 4 unchanged pixels or less between two adjacent dirty
// spans, it is all the same to just update through those pixels as well to not have to wait to flush the FIFO.
